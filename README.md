# REACT PROP PASSING CHALLENGE

<p>This one is very simple, and should be the one you start out with first out of the four React challenges in my repos. You will see that in the App.js file we have two components: the App component and the Person component. Your job is to make it so the Person component takes in props to display the Name, Age and Role of the person. After you figure that out, render two or three people within the App component using props.</p>

<p>If you get stuck, refer to the React documentation on passing props, or look at the App.js file in the Answer folder to see an example.</p>
