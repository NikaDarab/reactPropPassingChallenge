# REACT PROP PASSING CHALLENGE

<p>This one is very simple, and should be the one you start out with first out of the four challenges. You will see that in App.js we have two components: the App component and the Person componet. Your job is to make it where the Person component takes in props to display the Name, Age and Role of the person. Then render two or three people within the App component using props.</p>

<p>If you get stuck, refer to the React documentation on passing props, or look at the App.js file in the Answer folder to see an example.</p>
